        <h1>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</h1>
        <p>ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names wereâ€” Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.

            They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.</p>

        <p>"NOW, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go
            into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."

            "NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out."
